    <p>Welcome to the easiest activity generator of the decade.</p>
  </div>
  
    <p>JOMO is an acronym that stands for Joy of Missing Out,
      which is based on the motto of this website "Finding the
      Joy of Missing Out". This website was created by Jovy
      Cortez in July 2020 in order to help with the dilemma
      of parents, teachers, and even regular adults
      with the rise of PANDEMIC BOREDOM. With many people
      observing self-quarantine at home, it became hard to
      go out and do social activities, thus this world
      needs a spitting random-generator of fun activities. </br></br>
      Happy Clicking,
    </p>
